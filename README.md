# NeuralCT with Spatially-aware segmentation
**Author: Zhennong Chen, PhD**<br />

This repo is for the paper: 
*Motion Correction Image Reconstruction using NeuralCT Improves with Spatially Aware Object Segmentation* <br />
Authors: Zhennong Chen, Kunal Gupta, Francisco Contijoch<br />


Motion aware Computed Tomography 

Based on Kunal Gupta's NeuralCT program

New experiments：

1. experiment to test NeuralCT on different image noises: study_noise.py

2. experiment to adapt NeuralCT for objects (moving dots) with multiple intensities: study_dot_two_intensity.py

3. experiment to test NeuralCT for more complex topological change (transforming letters): in the folder: letter——experiments
